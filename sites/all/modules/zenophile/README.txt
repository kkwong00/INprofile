Zenophile allows themers to very easily create Zen subthemes without all the
tedious file copying and find-and-replacing required when creating subthemes by
hand.

Five-second instructions:
Install the module and go to Administration > Site building > Themes. Click the
"Create Zen subtheme" tab.

For more information, check out Zenophile's documentation page here:

Thanks for trying Zenophile!
